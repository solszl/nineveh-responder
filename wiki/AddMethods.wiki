• To follow you need be familiar with Usage Modes of NResponder. You can find all information about this here UsageModes.

= Introduction =

NResponder engine can work with it's own API of events or use the native Adobe® Flash® Event API. This means that you can use the NResponder to a custom event, like "doSearch" for example, or use it to a MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN ("mouseDown") in a button. Using NResponder to a native events you gain a lot of performance, because not the entire process of Native API of Flash is used and you can use all the benefits and features of NResponder, of course.

These two way can be accessed by `add()` and `addNative()` methods, respectively. Or using the parameter "isNative" in the constructor.
